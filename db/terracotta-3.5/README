= Building and running the Terracotta Distributed Server client for YCSB =

== Building the Terracotta DB client ==
1. Download and extract the Terracotta kit from one of the following 
locations: -
 a. (Open Source) http://terracotta.org/dl/oss-download-catalog
 b. (Enterprise) http://terracotta.org/dl/download-enterprise-ehcache

2. Copy the following Jars from the Terracotta open source or enterprise kit: -
 a. ehcache-core(-ee)-2.4.x.jar (from <extracted kit>/ehcache/lib)
 b. ehcache-terracotta(-ee)-2.4.x.jar (from <extracted kit>/ehcache/lib)
 c. slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar (from <extracted kit>/ehcache/lib)
 d. slf4j-jdk14-1.6.1.jar (from <extracted kit>/ehcache/lib)
 e. terracotta-toolkit-1.2-runtime-ee-3.0.0.jar  (from <extracted kit>/common)
3. run `ant db-terracotta-3.5` from the ycsb source directory

== Running with the Terracotta DB client ==

The DB client supports 2 main modes of operation viz. standalone and clustered.
In standalone mode there is only a local Ehcache. In clustered, a Terracotta 
Server Array backed Ehcahe is used. 

To run ENTERPRISE versions either of these modes, you need to use "-ee" 
versions of the jars listed above and copy a trial/enterprise license key into 
the db/terracotta-3.5/conf directory.

=== Setup instructions for standalone Ehcache ===
- Comment out the <tcConfigUrl> and <terracotta> elements in 
db/terracotta-3.5/conf/ehcache.xml

=== Setup instructions for clustered Ehcache ===
1. Install Terracotta on each of the nodes you will be using for the distributed
 cache.

2. Edit db\terracotta-3.5\conf\tc-config.xml and add a <server> node for each of the nodes that will be a part of the Terracotta Server Array.

3. In the <mirror-groups> section add a <mirror-group> node for each of the 
<server> nodes added above.

4. Copy the db\terracotta-3.5\conf\tc-config.xml to the Terracotta installation 
directory of each of the nodes.

5. Start up the Terracotta Server Array by doing the following on each of the 
nodes
 a. cd <terracotta install directory>
 b. bin/start-tc-server.sh -f tc-config.xml

6. Edit the db/terracotta-3.5/conf/ehcache.xml file and replace the host name 
in the configuration with the location of any one of the Terracotta servers 
set up above.

=== Running the test ===
1. Add this string "db/terracotta-3.5/lib/*:db/terracotta-3.5/conf" on Linux or 
"db\terracotta-3.5\lib\*;db\terracotta-3.5\conf" on Windows to the -cp argument
 when running the workload
2. pass in -Dcom.tc.productkey.path=db/terracotta-3.5conf/terracotta-license.key

e.g. java -cp build/ycsb.jar:db/terracotta-3.5/lib/*:db/terracotta-3.5/conf -Dcom.tc.productkey.path=db/terracotta-3.5/conf/terracotta-license.key com.yahoo.ycsb.Client -load -P workloads/workloadb -db com.yahoo.ycsb.db.TerracottaClient

= Running scan related workloads =

If you want to run scan related workloads (like workload E), you need to make a backup of
db/terracotta-ee-3.5/conf/ehcache.xml and rename db/terracotta-ee-3.5/conf/ehcache-scan.xml to 
db/terracotta-ee-3.5/conf/ehcache.xml.
